                    Bobby draws on the expansive landscapes and golden-hued prairie sunsets of his home province of Alberta for inspiration – whether weaved into candid lyrics or embodied through the ethereal melodies. Bobby pushes the boundaries of folk music by incorporating synths, manipulating found sound, and employs a palette of effects to achieve a sound like out of a dream. Pulling from a decade of experience with classical guitar, Bobby favors intricate fingerpicking techniques along with layered observational lyricism to explore vulnerability, societal issues, introspection, and emotional well-being. Bobby is influenced by the emotional production of Sufjan Stevens, the rawness of The Strokes, and the narrative-driven storytelling of Andy Shauf.
