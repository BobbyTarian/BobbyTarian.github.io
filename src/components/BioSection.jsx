                    Bobby is a singer-songwriter from Edmonton, Alberta.
                    Whether it’s weaved directly into his lyrics or being drawn on for inspiration, Bobby relies on the prairie sunsets and landscapes of his home province.
                    Though he now accompanies his singing with an electric guitar, Bobby spent most of his adolescence playing and teaching classical guitar.
                    By combining his love for classical guitar with his love for rock and folk music, he crafts his tunes using his fingerpicking and observational lyricism.
                    What comes through are his playful melodies along with lyrics that always have a hidden meaning behind the seemingly ordinary.
                    Bobby’s style is influenced by the likes of Sufjan Stevens, Tame Impala, The Strokes, and Andy Shauf.
