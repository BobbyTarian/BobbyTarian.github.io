                    Bobby Tarian captivates audiences with his tender lyrics and humility. 
                    Born and raised in Edmonton, his dreamy sound and storytelling is informed by introspection and the resplendent prairie sunsets.
                    His genre-blending indie-folk-synth-rock style is influenced by Sufjan Stevens, Tame Impala, The Strokes, and Andy Shauf.
                    Moon Remains Seasons Change, Bobby’s debut EP, received significant radio play on college radio stations across North America.
                    The track titled ”Remember” from this EP is featured in Michelle Vance Hehir’s theatre production “One Polaroid”. 
                    You can catch Bobby performing at various venues, open mics, and farmers markets in Edmonton.
